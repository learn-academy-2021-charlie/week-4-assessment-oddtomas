5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: The difference between a class and an object is that a class is the blueprint to the object(s). The class is the general outline that we can draw from to create unique individual classes. A class can detail what the possible attributes will be but the formed object is what will actually contain the specific details, like a height value, an actual color value, etc.

6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: "attr_accessor" replaces  traditional setters and getters in Ruby. Using  attr_accessor before you initialize, makes the code a little more stream line to where later on you can set/change a value without a setter, and access values without a getter. There is also attr_writer, and attr_reader which function just like a setter and getter method.
